# ATLAS — Where Travel Meets AI

> **AI-Powered Multi-Agent Travel Planning and Decision Support Platform**

ATLAS is an AI-powered travel platform designed to help users **discover destinations, plan trips, generate personalized itineraries, optimize travel decisions, and manage their journeys** through a coordinated multi-agent architecture.

Unlike a conventional travel recommendation system, ATLAS combines multiple specialized AI agents with user preferences, budget constraints, weather, routes, activities, food, accommodation, and traveler insights to create a personalized travel plan.

The architecture is designed so that each specialized agent focuses on a particular travel domain while the Planner Agent coordinates the overall planning process.

| Travel Time      | Reduce unnecessary travel                       |
| Ratings          | Prioritize highly rated options                 |
| Interests        | Match activities with user preferences          |
| Weather          | Adapt recommendations to conditions             |
| Opening Hours    | Avoid unavailable attractions                   |
| Accessibility    | Consider accessibility requirements             |
